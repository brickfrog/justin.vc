Hello! I'm Justin! I'm just a data scientist/software engineer who likes
learning things in his free time. Specifically, my interests generally fall into
Open source/emacs, applied mathematics/statistics, Catholic/Chinese history + poetry, & general media.

## Background {#background}


<div class="outline-2nil">

### Education {#education}

I have degrees in business and decision sciences from Florida State University / St. Joseph's University respectively. Most of my work was in decision theory for optimization of education outcomes. 

### Work {#work}

I was a business intelligence engineer / production support engineer at ADM after I finished grad school. I occasionally do consulting work (not open / generally direct connections) and assist startups with full stack development. I like to pride myself on being able to ramp up on new technologies and business domains quickly. I think every employment review has had some variation on "intellectual curiosity" - if I can be a bit not-so-humble.

<div class="outline-2nil">

### Technical {#technical}

In my day-to-day when working I'm generally using python. I use type/javascript when tinkering around with my various web apps. I know enough elisp to get by, but generally only use it for convenience functions in emacs. I've built a couple of things in Rust but my knowledge tends to atrophy due to lack of usage. Postgres is my favorite database and I like to use it for (most of) my projects. Other than that, I'm more of a "use what's best for the job" kind of guy, as long as it works and is maintainable.

#### This site {#this-site}

This site is created with a fork of [PaperModX](https://www.github.com/reorx/hugo-PaperModX), which I'm calling [PaperModulo](https://www.github.com/brickfrog/hugo-PaperModulo).
Almost everything is written as org-mode documents that I parse with ox-hugo. Hoping
that having -everything- as org mode documents makes it easier to write in
general, since I use org-mode for my agenda/todo lists, reading (org-noter +
pdf-tools) and {{% sidenote "f4"  coding. %}} Okay, sometimes I still use Jupyter and VSCode. Sue me. {{% /sidenote %}} There's also some usage of Google docs for things I need there to be
less friction on (e.g. - what I'm doing)

Hugo's a bit crusty - I'm not sure how much legs it still has but...

#### Using {#using}

I have my own little battlestation that I do my work on, I've never been a big
laptop person. This is probably (one of the many reasons) I'd do poorly as a
consultant. I like using Linux because {{% sidenote "f5"  "tiling window managers are neat." %}} See my [dotfiles](https://github.com/brickfrog/.dotfiles). {{% /sidenote %}} Outside
of not being able to (easily) do VR, I don't particularly miss Windows, and I've
never been a fan of MacOS. I'm just waiting for the day they put Asahi Linux on
the ARM chips.

TODO: more details here.

## Media Consumption {#now}

### Reading {#reading}

I try to do most of my tracking on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/brickfrog). I know, evil Amazon, but the API is pretty good. I try to backup my data but I'm not sure what other good alternatives are. Feel free to suggest some.

### Watching {#watching}

I last [watched](https://trakt.tv/users/justinvc) (show/movie respectively) via trakt.tv, I'd like to make a letterbox'd or somesuch but I think the API is closed down unless you can convince the devs, I don't like things that require manual updates because I forget to do them:

</div><br>

I use [anilist](https://anilist.co/user/brickfrog/) for tracking anime/manga. I
know there's a debate on MAL vs. AL, but I like the interface and the GraphQL is nice
once you get used to it (read: salty that brickfrog was taken on MAL). This is mostly programatically updated.

### Listening {#listening}

I don't listen to a lot of music, feel free to check my recently played tracks on [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/justinvc). The embed is a spotify playlist that I've been listening to recently on [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/1cvou29st17ac3qu1hzhnq7fw?si=9f1a873775c44bb6):

- [rateyourmusic.com](https://rateyourmusic.com/~justinvc) - I don't use this much, but I do use it to track my music collection. I'm not sure if I'll keep it up, but I do like the idea of having a collection of music I've listened to.
