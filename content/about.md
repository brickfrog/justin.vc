## Background {#background}

Hello! I'm Justin! I'm just a run-of-the-mill data scientist/software
engineer who likes learning things in his free time. Specifically, my interests
generally fall into Open source/emacs, applied mathematics/statistics,
programming language design, Catholic history, poetry, and general
pop-culture/anime/manga/-inserty nerdy thing here-.  I would also note that I'm
not a venture capitalist, despite said domain name. {{% sidenote "f1"  "Why justin.vc then?" %}}  I dunno, thought it sounded neat. I'm honestly baffled that Justin Kan didn't own the domain. But if you wander into this and you're a VC who's hiring, I wouldn't be opposed, just 'sayin {{% /sidenote %}}

I draw inspiration from [Gwern](https://gwern.net), in design, not content (mostly, I'm not
rewriting this into Haskell), but maybe I'll grow the writing chops eventually, but I also do not necessarily have
the want to engage in survive-the-end-times-canticle-of-st-leibowitz type of writing.
I plan to focus more on general notes and learnings. I would like to venture
into longform writing more, but that remains a future goal. If you can't tell by
now I'm pretty freeform-thought-of-conciousness in my thoughts. Hoping the more
I write the better I get about it. I was good at writing papers in
college, but that was when I -had- to. Those skills have kind of lapsed a decade
later.

### Technical {#technical}

In my day-to-day when working I'm generally using Python, at home I've started
to use Julia for more projects but I don't see as much non-research employment
opportunities in it yet. I admire the beauty of correctness in
Rust/Haskell/Idris, etc. but that's more of a side-hobby. If you can't tell I
tend to get nerd-sniped pretty easily, it's been something I've been working on.
It's honestly interesting how useful a plain linear regression is in the age of
deep learning. I think even new-entrants to the field could find enough
low-hanging-fruit to keep themselves busy with classical statistical methods and
rudimentary machine learning.

That being said, I'm mostly self-educated when it comes to mathematics and coding. My
undergraduate degree was in business and real estate. I actually was doing a
double major with religion but didn't finish it. (Not so fun) fact, I originally
wanted to be a priest. I did a graduate-degree in decision sciences, but there's
only so much you can cover in two years. I primarily focused on optimization and
information systems at that time with my "capstone" focus on education system
turnouts in Bolivia.

### Using {#using}

I have my own little battlestation that I do my work on, I've never been a big
laptop person. This is probably (one of the many reasons) I'd do poorly as a
consultant. I like using Linux because {{% sidenote "f5"  "tiling window managers are neat." %}}  See my [dotfiles](https://github.com/brickfrog/.dotfiles). {{% /sidenote %}} Outside
of not being able to (easily) do VR, I don't particularly miss Windows, and I've
never been a fan of MacOS. I'm just waiting for the day they put Asahi Linux on
the ARM chips.

This site is created with a fork of [PaperModX](https://www.github.com/reorx/hugo-PaperModX), which I'm calling [PaperModulo](https://www.github.com/brickfrog/hugo-PaperModulo).
Everything is written as org-mode documents that I parse with ox-hugo. Hoping
that having -everything- as org mode documents makes it easier to write in
general, since I use org-mode for my agenda/todo lists, reading (org-noter +
pdf-tools) and {{% sidenote "f4"  coding. %}}  Okay, sometimes I still use Jupyter and VSCode. Sue me. {{% /sidenote %}}
