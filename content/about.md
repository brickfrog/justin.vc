Hello! I'm Justin! I'm just a run-of-the-mill data scientist/software
 engineer who likes learning things in his free time. Specifically, my interests
 generally fall into Open source/emacs, applied mathematics/statistics,
 programming language design, Catholic history, poetry, and general pop-culture/anime.

In my day-to-day when working I'm generally using Python, at home I've started
to use Julia for more projects but I don't see as much non-research employment
opportunities in it yet. I admire the beauty of correctness in
Rust/Haskell/Idris, etc. but that's more of a side-hobby. If you can't tell I
tend to get nerd-sniped pretty easily, it's been something I've been working on.
I would also note that I'm not a
 venture capitalist, despite said domain name. {{% sidenote "f1"  "Why justin.vc then?" %}}  I dunno, thought it sounded neat. I'm honestly baffled that Justin Kan didn't own the domain. But if you wander into this and you're a VC who's hiring, I wouldn't be opposed, just 'sayin {{% /sidenote %}}

I  draw inspiration from [Gwern](https://gwern.net), in design, not content,
maybe I'll grow the writing chops eventually, but I also do not necessarily have
the want to engage in survive-the-end-times-canticle-of-st-leibowitz type of writing.
I plan to focus more on general notes and learnings. I would like to venture
into longform writing more, but that remains a future goal.


## Personal Links {#personal-links}


### Books/Reading {#books-reading}

I like to read.

-   [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/brickfrog) - I try to keep books I read up to date / suggestions, etc. All
    reviews/notes will be here, but I find the Goodreads API useful for marking
    things from Calibre. I mostly read non-fiction but I do enjoy science fiction.


### Media/Watching {#media-watching}

I like to watch things. I usually try to watch anything thats critically
acclaimed in some way.

-   [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/users/justinvc) - television/movies watched,
    programatically updated/scrobbled. May duplicate things if I fall asleep
    watching them, and I tend to watch things at x2-4 speed unless
    high-art/prestige.
-   [Anilist](https://anilist.co/user/brickfrog/) - similar to Trakt, but anime/manga, programatically updated for
    anime. Might make a myanimelist also to sync between later. Truthfully only
    chose one over the other because there was easier syncing for the former.


### Music/Listening {#music-listening}

Music doesn't really tend to do much for me unless paired with visuals I can see. Trying to get more into it,
but I generally only use music as a distraction in noisy environments.

-   [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/justinvc) - music scrobbled from Spotify
-   [rateyourmusic](https://rateyourmusic.com/~justinvc) - rating albums,
    manually updated (rarely)
