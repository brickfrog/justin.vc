I am justin. i do data + software. mostly interested in whatever is eating my brain at the time—usually something in the venn of open source, emacs, applied math/stats, catholic or chinese history (poetry too), and just... media in general.

## Background {#background}


<div class="outline-2nil">

### Education {#education}

business undergrad (fsu), decision sciences grad (st. joe’s). most of my thesis-y brain cycles went to optimizing educational outcomes through decision theory. think: stats + apis for education admin & government.

### Work {#work}

was doing BI + production support at ADM post-grad. now i ghostwrite code for startups, mostly via direct lines—no public consulting funnel or anything. i pick up new stacks and domains fast

<div class="outline-2nil">

### Technical {#technical}

tools are tools. if it works, i’ll use it. i’ve aged out of tech tribalism. still, postgres supremacy. everything i spin up ends up back on it eventually.

<div class="outline-3nil">

#### This site {#this-site}

glued together with my own fork of PaperModX—called it PaperModulo bc i like bad puns and functional metaphors. all the content is org-mode, bc my life already lives in emacs (org-agenda, org-noter, etc). the build process is ox-hugo. still cheating with jupyter + vscode when i don’t feel like fighting the editor war that day.

hugo’s mid, honestly. no idea how long i’ll stick with it.

<div class="outline-3nil">

#### Using {#using}

desktop main. laptops feel like punishment. maybe i’d suck at consulting for that reason alone.
linux user (duh). tiling WMs go hard. [dotfiles here.](https://github.com/brickfrog/.dotfiles).

TODO: more details here.

### Watching {#watching}

tv + movies tracked via [trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/users/justinvc) used to want letterboxd but the api’s a walled garden now. i forget to update things manually so that’s a no-go.
