## Background {#background}

<div class="outline-2nil">

### Education {#education}

business undergrad (fsu) - originally wanted to be a tax/fraud analyst - after taking a database class, I got into information systems. decision sciences grad (st. joe’s). most of my thesis-y brain cycles went to optimizing educational outcomes through decision theory. think: stats + apis for education admin & government.

### Work {#work}

was doing BI + production support at ADM post-grad. now i ghostwrite code for startups, mostly via direct lines—no public consulting funnel or anything. i pick up new stacks and domains fast. ~~currently at [io.net](https://io.net) - doing agentic LLM stuff.~~ (note to self: grill harder about company profitability when joining places)

### Watching {#watching}

should make a letterboxd but the api’s a walled garden now. i forget to update things manually. trakt doubled their prices, so most of my media now is jellyfin + self-hosted tracker - rip things, watch, ezpz. TODO: figure out a good way to track - webhooks + PDS?

anime/manga on [anilist](https://anilist.co/user/brickfrog/) - most of this is tracked automatically. might want to mirror to MAL sometime.
