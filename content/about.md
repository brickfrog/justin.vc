Hello! I'm Justin! I'm just a run-of-the-mill data scientist/software
engineer who likes learning things in his free time. Specifically, my interests
generally fall into Open source/emacs, applied mathematics/statistics,
programming language design, Catholic history, poetry, and general
pop-culture/anime/manga/-inserty nerdy thing here-.  I would also note that I'm
not a venture capitalist, despite said domain name. {{% sidenote "f1"  "Why justin.vc then?" %}}  I dunno, thought it sounded neat. I'm honestly baffled that Justin Kan didn't own the domain. But if you wander into this and you're a VC who's hiring, I wouldn't be opposed, just 'sayin {{% /sidenote %}}

I draw inspiration from [Gwern](https://gwern.net), in design, not content (mostly, I'm not
rewriting this into Haskell), but maybe I'll grow the writing chops eventually, but I also do not necessarily have
the want to engage in survive-the-end-times-canticle-of-st-leibowitz type of writing.
I plan to focus more on general notes and learnings. I would like to venture
into longform writing more, but that remains a future goal. If you can't tell by
now I'm pretty freeform-thought-of-conciousness in my thoughts. Hoping the more
I write the better I get about it. I was good at writing papers in
college, but that was when I -had- to. Those skills have kind of lapsed a decade
later.

Right now I'm basically vibing in the rural United States, having been on
sabbatical for a year. I mean, I call it a sabbatical but it's more of a weird
covid break combined with wanting to randomly tinker around with other things.
Dealing with corporate dashboards gets a bit soul draining after awhile. Would
like to eventually move to a more walkable urban environment as the
kick-in-the-pants to be (more) social. Difficult to want to do things when you
have to drive 30 minutes.

This site is created with a fork of [PaperModX](https://www.github.com/reorx/hugo-PaperModX), which I'm calling [PaperModulo](https://www.github.com/brickfrog/hugo-PaperModulo).
Everything is written as org-mode documents that I parse with ox-hugo. Hoping
that having -everything- as org mode documents makes it easier to write in
general, since I use org-mode for my agenda/todo lists, reading (org-noter +
pdf-tools) and {{% sidenote "f4"  coding. %}}  Okay, sometimes I still use Jupyter and VSCode. Sue me. {{% /sidenote %}}

In my day-to-day when working I'm generally using Python, at home I've started
to use Julia for more projects but I don't see as much non-research employment
opportunities in it yet. I admire the beauty of correctness in
Rust/Haskell/Idris, etc. but that's more of a side-hobby. If you can't tell I
tend to get nerd-sniped pretty easily, it's been something I've been working on.
It's honestly interesting how useful a plain linear regression is in the age of
deep learning. I think even new-entrants to the field could find enough
low-hanging-fruit to keep themselves busy with classical statistical methods and
rudimentary machine learning.

That being said, I'm mostly self-educated when it comes to mathematics and coding. My
undergraduate degree was in business and real estate. I actually was doing a
double major with religion but didn't finish it. (Not so fun) fact, I originally
wanted to be a priest. I did a graduate-degree in decision sciences, but there's
only so much you can cover in two years. I primarily focused on optimization and
information systems at that time with my "capstone" focus on education system
turnouts in Bolivia.

I have my own little battlestation that I do my work on, I've never been a big
laptop person. This is probably (one of the many reasons) I'd do poorly as a
consultant. I like using Linux because {{% sidenote "f5"  "tiling window managers are neat." %}}  See my [dotfiles](https://github.com/brickfrog/.dotfiles). {{% /sidenote %}} Outside
of not being able to (easily) do VR, I don't particularly miss Windows, and I've
never been a fan of MacOS. I'm just waiting for the day they put Asahi Linux on
the ARM chips.

## Personal Links {#personal-links}

I think the linktree style svg's of all your associated links are a bit gauche.
Give me a good 'ole table-of-contents-style of list.


### Subdomains {#subdomains}

Sites that are part of this site, generally things that are separated off and
built using different technologies. Generally all hosted on github.

-   <https://quotes.justin.vc> - There's a neat extension called
    [Quotebacks](https://quotebacks.net/) for chrome/firefox that lets you record snippets of text. It's
    useful for display, but it also saves things as JSON, which I parse and just
    toss into this site. Not the prettiest thing, but it gives a breakdown of
    things I'm randomly reading or have seen other people say. I think they've
    since stopped updating it, but it still works, so, eh. Might write a parser to
    put them into a table and make as a section of this site.

-   <https://zk.justin.vc> - The original top-level of this site, a zettelkasten
    written in TiddlyWiki. It has its own about page, but a lot of it I need to
    rewrite. I'm working on some pandoc filters to move my "general notes"
    programatically to it. Effectively a brain dump and more meant for my own
    uses.


### Social Media/Following {#social-media-following}

Outside of things listed on blogroll, I don't tend to like social media and talk
to most friends via signal / matrix /{{% sidenote "f2"  "telegram." %}}  Yeah, yeah, I know. The bots are neat and it's mostly spamming stickers to my friends. {{% /sidenote %}}
Probably falling on deaf ears, but most social media is a waste of time outside
of finding friends. Once you've found said friends, what's the point, really? I
get existential ennui, but, like, go read a book or get involved in your
community (unless you're getting paid to post, I guess, then continue on).

-   [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/justin-tm) - I try to keep up with (job) roles and such in this. I keep descriptions
    blank because it's basically just used to datamine. I figure if someone's -really-
    interested in someone as a candidate they'd be {{% sidenote "f3"  "reading this instead." %}}  Hi recruiters \/ hiring managers! If you read this feel free to mention it. You\'d be surprised how often people don't do a cursory reading of something other than their resume. Usually garners more points from my side. {{% /sidenote %}}
-   [Github](https://www.github.com/brickfrog) - Keep most coding stuff here. I'm not a -huge- fan of Microsoft, but
    I like the UI better than Gitlab, and now that they have actions, there's
    not really a killer feature differentiating the two.


### Books/Reading {#books-reading}

I like to read. Generally non-fiction (technical / history / religion) and then
science fiction / fantasy.

-   [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/brickfrog) - I try to keep books I read up to date / suggestions, etc. All
    reviews/notes are generally hosted locally, but I'd like to venture into book
    review type of writing. I do find the Goodreads API useful for marking
    things from Calibre so it's generally used to just to keep track of things in
    a way people can see.


### Media/Watching {#media-watching}

I like to watch things. I usually try to watch anything thats critically
acclaimed in some way. I should probably cut back on it though. I've noticed
that even highly rated stuff nowadays doesn't really compare to written works.

-   [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/users/justinvc) - television/movies watched,
    programatically updated/scrobbled. May duplicate things if I fall asleep
    watching them, and I tend to watch things at x2-4 speed unless
    high-art/prestige.
-   [Anilist](https://anilist.co/user/brickfrog/) - similar to Trakt, but anime/manga, programatically updated for
    anime. Might make a myanimelist also to sync between later. Truthfully only
    chose one over the other because there was easier syncing for the former.


### Music/Listening {#music-listening}

Music doesn't really tend to do much for me unless paired with visuals I can see. Trying to get more into it,
but I generally only use music as a distraction in noisy environments. On the
rare occasions I'm listening to things I like ambient post-rock /
doom/sludge/stoner metal with occasional euro-dance / jazz. I feel like I would
also have to turn in my southerner card if I didn't admit to liking bluegrass
and gospel.

-   [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/justinvc) - music scrobbled from Spotify
-   [rateyourmusic](https://rateyourmusic.com/~justinvc) - rating albums,
    manually updated (rarely - a note to do this more)
