## Summary {#summary}

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used for managing and manipulating data stored in relational databases. It allows you to perform operations such as:

SELECTing data from a database, to retrieve specific information.
INSERTING data into a database, to add new records.
UPDATING data in a database, to modify existing records.
DELETING data from a database, to remove records.
SQL is based on a set of commands, called statements, that are used to interact with a database. The syntax of these statements is standardized, so that SQL can be used with a variety of different database management systems, including MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.

SQL is used in a wide range of applications, from simple websites that store information about users and products, to complex data analytics systems that process large amounts of data in real-time. It is a versatile and powerful tool that is essential for working with relational databases.
