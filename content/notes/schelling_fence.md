## Summary {#summary}

it seems that the concept of a "Schelling fence" is used in the context of
precommitment and avoiding slippery slopes.

In game theory and decision theory, a precommitment is a strategy or action that
an individual or group takes in advance to limit their future options or to
signal their future behavior to others. A slippery slope refers to a situation
where taking one action can lead to a series of increasingly negative outcomes
or consequences.

In the context of a Schelling fence, it appears that establishing a clear and
credible point of agreement or coordination among different interest groups can
help prevent a slippery slope by limiting the range of acceptable outcomes. This
could involve setting a clear boundary or rule that all parties agree to defend
in order to prevent more extreme or harmful outcomes from occurring.

Overall, the concept of a Schelling fence appears to be related to the idea of
establishing a focal point or point of agreement among individuals or groups to
guide their behavior and prevent undesirable outcomes.

Scott Alexander's post.

Slippery slopes can sometimes be avoided by establishing a "Schelling fence" - a
Schelling point that the various interest groups involved - or yourself across
different values and times - make a credible precommitment to defend.
