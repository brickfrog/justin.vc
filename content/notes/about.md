Hello! I'm Justin! I'm just a data scientist/software engineer who likes
learning things in his free time. Specifically, my interests generally fall into
Open source/emacs, applied mathematics/statistics, Catholic history, poetry, and general
pop-culture/anime/manga/-insert nerdy thing here-.


## Background {#background}

I draw inspiration from [Gwern](https://gwern.net), in design, not content (mostly, I'm not
rewriting this into Haskell), but maybe I'll grow the writing chops eventually, but I also do not necessarily have
the want to engage in survive-the-end-times-canticle-of-st-leibowitz type of writing.
I plan to focus more on general notes and learnings. I would like to venture
into longform writing more, but that remains a future goal. If you can't tell by
now I'm pretty freeform-thought-of-conciousness in my thoughts. Hoping the more
I write the better I get about it. I was good at writing papers in
college, but that was when I -had- to. Those skills have kind of lapsed a decade
later.


### Technical {#technical}

In my day-to-day when working I'm generally using Python, at home I've started
to use Julia for more projects but I don't see as much non-research employment
opportunities in it yet. I admire the beauty of correctness in
Rust/Haskell/Idris, etc. but that's more of a side-hobby. If you can't tell I
tend to get nerd-sniped pretty easily, it's been something I've been working on.
It's honestly interesting how useful a plain linear regression is in the age of
deep learning. I think even new-entrants to the field could find enough
low-hanging-fruit to keep themselves busy with classical statistical methods and
rudimentary machine learning.

That being said, I'm mostly self-educated when it comes to mathematics and coding. My
undergraduate degree was in business and real estate. I actually was doing a
double major with religion but didn't finish it. (Not so fun) fact, I originally
wanted to be a priest. I did a graduate-degree in decision sciences, but there's
only so much you can cover in two years. I primarily focused on optimization and
information systems at that time with my "capstone" focus on education system
turnouts in Bolivia.


#### This site {#this-site}

This site is created with a fork of [PaperModX](https://www.github.com/reorx/hugo-PaperModX), which I'm calling [PaperModulo](https://www.github.com/brickfrog/hugo-PaperModulo).
Almost everything is written as org-mode documents that I parse with ox-hugo. Hoping
that having -everything- as org mode documents makes it easier to write in
general, since I use org-mode for my agenda/todo lists, reading (org-noter +
pdf-tools) and {{% sidenote "f4"  coding. %}}  Okay, sometimes I still use Jupyter and VSCode. Sue me. {{% /sidenote %}} There's also some usage of Google docs for things I need there to be
less friction on (e.g. - what I'm doing)


#### Using {#using}

I have my own little battlestation that I do my work on, I've never been a big
laptop person. This is probably (one of the many reasons) I'd do poorly as a
consultant. I like using Linux because {{% sidenote "f5"  "tiling window managers are neat." %}}  See my [dotfiles](https://github.com/brickfrog/.dotfiles). {{% /sidenote %}} Outside
of not being able to (easily) do VR, I don't particularly miss Windows, and I've
never been a fan of MacOS. I'm just waiting for the day they put Asahi Linux on
the ARM chips.

Beep. Beep. Future TODO, show rig, details on toolings, etc.

Still need to do this. Sorry.
