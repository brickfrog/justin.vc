This is a now page, a page that I update every so often to let you know what I'm up to. It's inspired by Derek Sivers' [now page](https://sive.rs/nowff). It allows a seperation of the "what I'm doing" from the "who I am" and "what I've done".

Right now I'm basically vibing in the rural United States, having been on
sabbatical for a year. I mean, I call it a sabbatical but it's more of a weird
covid break combined with wanting to randomly tinker around with other things.
Dealing with corporate dashboards gets a bit soul draining after awhile. Would
like to eventually move to a more walkable urban environment as the
kick-in-the-pants to be (more) social. Difficult to want to do things when you
have to drive 30 minutes.

### Doing

Working on this site, an excuse to learn more javascript and CSS and HTML, etc. etc. Additionally working on reading data science / statistics content - have to get back into the 'ole grind eventually. Additionally want to somehow automate my "daily" notes in org-roam into a weekly post, think Marginal Revolution's Weekly Roundup.

### Reading

I try to do most of my tracking on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/brickfrog). I know, evil Amazon, but the API is pretty good. I try to backup my data but I'm not sure what other good alternatives are. Feel free to suggest some.

### Watching

I last [watched](trakt.tv/users/justinvc) (show/movie respectively) via Trakt.tv:

</div>

I use [anilist](https://anilist.co/user/brickfrog/) for tracking anime/manga. I
know there's a debate on MAL vs. AL, but I like the interface and the GraphQL is nice
once you get used to it. (read: salty that brickfrog was taken on MAL)

### Listening

I don't listen to a lot of music, feel free to check my recently played tracks on [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/justinvc). The embed is a spotify playlist that I've been listening to recently on [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/1cvou29st17ac3qu1hzhnq7fw?si=9f1a873775c44bb6):

- [rateyourmusic.com](https://rateyourmusic.com/~justinvc) - I don't use this much, but I do use it to track my music collection. I'm not sure if I'll keep it up, but I do like the idea of having a collection of music I've listened to.
