This is a now page, a page that I update every so often to let you know what I'm up to. It's inspired by Derek Sivers' [now page](https://sive.rs/nowff). Incidentally, there's some overlap with my .plan file, and I'm pondering how to reconcile it all. I still like this for keeping up with my reading/watching, etc. etc.

### Doing

### Reading

<hr class="now-divider">

I try to do most of my tracking on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/brickfrog). I know, evil Amazon, but the API is pretty good. I try to backup my data but I'm not sure what other good alternatives are. Feel free to suggest some.

### Watching

<hr class="now-divider">

I last [watched](trakt.tv/users/justinvc) (show/movie respectively) via Trakt.tv:

</div>

I use [anilist](https://anilist.co/user/brickfrog/) for tracking anime/manga. I
know there's a debate on MAL vs. AL, but I like the interface and the GraphQL is nice
once you get used to it. (read: salty that brickfrog was taken on MAL)

### Listening

<hr class="now-divider">

I don't listen to a lot of music, feel free to check my recently played tracks on [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/justinvc). The embed is a spotify playlist that I've been listening to recently on [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/1cvou29st17ac3qu1hzhnq7fw?si=9f1a873775c44bb6):

- [rateyourmusic.com](https://rateyourmusic.com/~justinvc) - I don't use this much, but I do use it to track my music collection. I'm not sure if I'll keep it up, but I do like the idea of having a collection of music I've listened to.
