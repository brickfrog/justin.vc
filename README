Hugo-site for blog.

.idea 

* reader mode should expand out the sidelinks so no clicking necessary
* think about how footnotes will look - need to write more stuff
* figure out TODO blah blah blah etc from emacs
* maybe dropdown for sidebar like gwern's cog thingy
* cloudflare worker google doc embed
* TOC too far off to left, hug closer to body
* dark/light mode on sidebar too
