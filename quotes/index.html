The problem is that an issue is not necessarily completely invalid just because Fox News mentions it.

Use trunk-based development whenever possible - it's easier on multitude of levels.

They’re a riff on micromorts, a one-in-a-million chance of dying. Risk analysts use micromorts to compare how dangerous different things are: scuba diving is 5 micromorts per dive; COVID is 2,500 micromorts per infection; climbing Mt. Everest is 30,000 micromorts per attempt. So by analogy, micromarriages are a one in a million chance of getting married. Maybe going to a party gets you 500 micromarriages, and signing up for a really good dating site gives you 10,000. If there’s a Mt. Everest equivalent, I don’t know about it.</td></tr><tr><td><a href=https://twitter.com/hamandcheese/status/1478850572677791749><b class=url>Samuel Hammond 🌐🏛 on Twitter</b></a></td><td class=date>22/01/06</td><td class=quote>The worlds most accomplished computer programmer would instantly become "low skill" if they time travelled to the 16th century.</td></tr><tr><td><a href=https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/no-seriously-hate-your-tools/><b class=url>No Seriously, Hate Your Tools</b></a></td><td class=date>21/12/31</td><td class=quote>We’re better at finding flaws in claims we <em>don’t</em> agree with than claims we <em>do</em>.
