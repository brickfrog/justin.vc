Indeed, reading a voter’s guide is much better: there’s no recency bias (where you only remember the crimes reported in the past couple months), you get to hear both sides of the story after the investigation has died down, you can actually think about the issues instead of worrying about the politics."

Everest is 30,000 micromorts per attempt. So by analogy, micromarriages are a one in a million chance of getting married.

She was a deeply close-minded, cruel, and unpleasant person and she struggled to hide that part of herself in public interactions. Joyce is... not that. Joyce is urbane, witty, and friendly. She seems like a true citizen of the world, fascinated by all it has to offer, and freely admits she doesn't work for good people.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The point of Joyce in the game is to throw you off the scent. If you're a leftist coming into a game like this, you automatically have some sympathy for the union and mistrust of the corporation. But Joyce is charismatic and helpful, while Evrart is antagonistic and seemingly corrupt. If you're not a leftist, you take them at face value.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">But this is a bait-and-switch. Evrart is only corrupt as a means to an end, and is secretly pursuing the far more moral and sympathetic goal: the economic freedom of Revachol from the Coalition. Joyce, meanwhile, is not a better person because she's aware she works for bad people. If anything, her awareness of it makes her <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">worse</em>. The way she describes \"slumming it\" in Martinaise as a youth also shows that while she might be worldly and hip, she's also fundamentally predatory towards these communities, taking what she wants from them and moving on. She has literally sold her soul to her corporate masters, as the Pale may very well have eradicated who she was and you have no idea how much of the persona she presents to you is accurate to who she is, or if there even really is one \"Joyce.\"</p>"
