      <description>&lt;p&gt;Honestly i haven&amp;rsquo;t had the urge to write as much bc pretty much most problems
i&amp;rsquo;ve run into have been solvable by llms. i&amp;rsquo;ve been using cursor and other ai
tools to build things and i think it&amp;rsquo;s pretty neat. i&amp;rsquo;m in awe and terrified at
what I&amp;rsquo;m seeing people use these tools for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a dumb comparison, but i like to think of the current state of ai
tools, particularly agentic code as &lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;
&lt;label class=&#34;sidenote-label&#34; for=&#34;f1&#34;&gt;mr. meseeks&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input class=&#34;sidenote-checkbox&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;f1&#34;&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote-content
sidenote-right&#34;&gt;  I am sure someone has made this comparison before but it just kind of popped into my mind when I watched claude flail around and panic suggest deleting my entire database. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtube.com/watch?v=qUYvIAP3qQk&#34;&gt;rick &amp;amp; morty&lt;/a&gt;, if it can&amp;rsquo;t
figure it out it eventually will get &amp;lsquo;stressed out&amp;rsquo; and do insane things to try
and finish the original task:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

tools to build things and i think it&rsquo;s pretty neat. i&rsquo;m in awe and terrified at
what I&rsquo;m seeing people use these tools for.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bit of a dumb comparison, but i like to think of the current state of ai
tools, particularly agentic code as <span class="sidenote">
<label class="sidenote-label" for="f1">mr. meseeks</label>
<input class="sidenote-checkbox" type="checkbox" id="f1"></input>
<span class="sidenote-content
sidenote-right">  I am sure someone has made this comparison before but it just kind of popped into my mind when I watched claude flail around and panic suggest deleting my entire database. </span>
</span> from <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qUYvIAP3qQk">rick &amp; morty</a>, if it can&rsquo;t
figure it out it eventually will get &lsquo;stressed out&rsquo; and do insane things to try
and finish the original task:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;i can&rsquo;t finish this linter error&hellip; screw it, i&rsquo;m deleting it all!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;this table isn&rsquo;t working correctly, let&rsquo;s just drop it&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;WHY WONT THIS DEV DOCKER CONTAINER BUILD ILL JUST READ YOUR .ENV AND HARDCODE A PRODUCTION KEY&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;unit tests? lol. lmao. let&rsquo;s just edit the tests to conform to new code,
it&rsquo;s fine - it&rsquo;s fine&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>you can get past most of these things with proper prompting / knowing when to
clear your history, etc. but i don&rsquo;t think most people will do that. -insert
twitter/x meme image of old people at casino pulling slots here-</p>
<p>this could probably usher in decentralization more than people think. the
ability to go: &ldquo;i want a budgeting app that accounts for&hellip; -insert weird niche
thing-&rdquo; and have it built in a day or two will probably help a lot of people.
micro-apps where you don&rsquo;t really need to worry about network security is one of
the biggest strengths of these things.</p>
<p>on the other hand, we&rsquo;re going to get so&hellip; so much more slop, so much unsecure
slop with people blindly hardcoding credentials, because some influencer told
them they cant retire early by spamming out garbage sass products (same as it
ever was).</p>
<p>hell, maybe even more centralization with bad sass products promising to abstract away the pain - &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t need to
know about sql injection if you blindly trust the ORM and some stupid online hosted db!&rdquo;</p>
<p>eventually the tools will get good enough to self-correct, but by that point,
quite a lot of people will find out their jobs aren&rsquo;t that useful anymore.</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think i&rsquo;m cut out for waxing poetic on the state of technology.</p>
<p>fun times. i wish i went into cybersecurity.</p>
